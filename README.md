# knn_Classification_ipnb.iris
# First i save my iris data "iris = load_iris()", then I check "feature_names" """iris.feature_names"""
# Next I load my data into columns and save it as "df" """df = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)""" and I check the shape """df.shape"""
# Then I create new column "target" """df['target']= iris.target""" and I check how my "target1" look like and also "target2"
# I have my "target" column, so I can create column "flower_name" using my "target" """df['flower_name'] = df.target.apply(lambda x : iris.target_names[x])"""
# I create (3) different "df" with my "flower_name" (form 0 to 50, from 50 to 100, form 100 to 150) 
# Next I visualize my data use "%matplotlib inline", using "df0" and "df1" and column "sepal length " and "sepal width"
# Then I visualize "df0" and "df1" but with column "petal length" and "petal width"
# I import "train_test_split" and prepare my "X" and "y" "X" will be my "df" without column "target" and "flower_name"
# And "y" will be my "df.target", now i can get "train" and "test" set using "train_test_split", I can also check length of my sets using "len"
# Then from "sklearn.neighbors" import "KNeighborsClassifier" and set parameter "n_neighbors" at (3), then train my model """knn.fit(X_train, y_train)"""
# Iget my score "knn.score(X_train, y_train)" and prepare "y_pred" using "X_test" """y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)"""
# Next from "sklearn.metrics" import "confusion_matrix" and then I supplement my "confusion_matrix" with "y_test" and y_pred
# Then I import "seaborn" and supplement it with my "confusion_matrix"
